## My submission

This is my very first R markdown and it's purpose is to be submitted as part of my course project.  
  
*Note*: Although the instructions say it's pretty straightforward, I don't really know what to do, I would've rather having a list of the items we were supposed to include, so I hope **this** suffices.
